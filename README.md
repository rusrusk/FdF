# FdF

The fdf application is a wireframe generator that processes files in the .fdf format and converts them into three-dimensional depictions of terrain landscapes. It handles color schemes and fundamental modifications, such as zooming, shifting, rotation, and scaling along the Z axis. The primary objective of this project is to acquaint students with window manipulation and pixel integration on the display by utilizing the MinilibX library and coding in pure C.
